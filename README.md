## Introduction
I worked in a team of 3 that built this project over the course of 36 hours at HackUPC. I worked on building the Firebase backend, which used cloud functions to query various API's for the client. This proved particularly challenging as I had never worked with JavaScript before, but despite this I managed to complete what I set out to. All the code I produced over the course of the hackathon is in the folder Firebase backend, and I have also documented the API I produced.
